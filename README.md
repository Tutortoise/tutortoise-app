# Tutortoise Mobile App

## Setup

1. Create or edit `local.properties` file in the root project directory
2. Add the following line to configure the API base URL:
```properties
base.url=https://tutortoise-backend-685913882179.asia-southeast2.run.app/api/v1/
```

Note: The `local.properties` file is not tracked by Git as it may contain sensitive information. If you're cloning this project for the first time, you'll need to create this file manually.
